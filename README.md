# Template for creating a cv with react

Use the templatePage.sh script with two arguments (role/project/organization, organization). This will create an md file with expected frontmatter. The script with attempt to open the file with vsCode. Just sub in your editor of choice

My cv folder env var is pointed at an external var to not mix personal information with the template, probably should set the templatePage script to do the same thing...
